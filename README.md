- Hi, I’m @forumdesaiii
- I’m interested in building my technical skills as they aren't as proficient and would like to continue growing. Also, I'm interested in getting hands-on experience whether it's work experience or doing projects. 
- I’m currently learning Business Analytica and Information Technology alongside my interest in Data Science.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any HTML, Python, SQL and/or C++ projects.
